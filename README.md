# Calculator

## Problem Statement:

Developing a Calculator after learning basic of HTML, CSS & JavaScript is one of the best
ways to understand the core concept and implement it to make something useful.
This Calculator you can modify as per your need to perform both simple and complex
calculations. It should include +, -, *, / operations along with calculating modulo (%) and
performing square of a number. Also, add AC (All Clear) button to clear the current text
and Equal key for performing the operation. The calculator should perform operation
using both Decimal and Whole numbers.

## Problem description

The primary aim of this project is to create a user-friendly, web-based calculator that demonstrates the practical application of foundational web development technologiesâ€”namely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator is intended to support a broad range of arithmetic operations, making it a useful tool for performing everyday mathematical calculations. Through this project, learners and developers can deepen their understanding of how to build interactive web applications by integrating structure (HTML), design (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript).
By developing this calculator, one gains hands-on experience with core programming concepts such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and real-time data processing. Additionally, it provides insight into building responsive and intuitive user interfaces that enhance the overall user experience. This project is especially valuable for beginners, as it offers a meaningful and functional way to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world scenario while also laying the groundwork for more complex web development tasks in the future.

## Web Technologies Used:

1.HTML
2.CSS
3.JavaScript

## Steps followed While Deploying:
*Firstly I built the complete project using visual studio code,then tested it on the live server extension's.
After that I have installed the git on my system.
After that I uploded and committed the project into my github repositry.
The project was deployed using the github pages and tested it.
